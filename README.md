# COMP3016 CW2 Proposal – Oliver Cole
## Working title:
Beneath ancient sands
## Overview:
I aim to create an exploration game written in C++ using OpenGL. The game is set in
an ancient city buried in the desert sands. The player will explore the environment using
keyboard and mouse, traversing procedurally generated sand terrain and some ruined
ancient structures to locate a hidden ancient artefact.
The player will be within a desert environment bounded by the partially submerged
ruins which guide the player to explore forwards. The primary gameplay objective is to
locate an ancient artefact within the ruins.
## Details:
The environment will consist of a procedurally generated desert terrain representing
sand dunes, as well as static ruins structured sourced from free assets online. These
structures will be positioned to look as if submerged by the sands over time, creating an
abandoned and ancient vibe.
A main artefact will be the players goal to obtain and will be visually highlighted as
the objective, possibly by rotating on a pedestal. The atmosphere will be supported
through use of directional lighting and music, changing when near the artefact for
suspense and guide progression.
The project will be developed in C++ using OpenGL techniques. It will demonstrate realtime rendering, keyboard/mouse interaction, procedural content generation and
loading/rendering of external 3D models.
## Libraries and Tools:
- GLAD OpenGl loading
- GLFW Window creationg and input handling
- ASSIMP Loading external 3D models
- Irrklang Audio
## Advanced:
The project aims to include advanced features such as dynamic lighting and the use of
audio to enhance atmosphere and immersion.
